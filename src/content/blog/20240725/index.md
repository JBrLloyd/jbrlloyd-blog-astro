## Understand the Big Picture

In every business, it’s essential to know the company goals, in most growing companies the goals are centralised around an overarching outcome of growing an active customer base and/or profits (note that you can attempt to decline in one to grow the other). However, these are not goals, they’re outcomes, so what are the company goals that get you there?

We first must acknowledge that company goals are not set in stone, in fact, they can change half annually or annually, this is because company goals are generally strategic goals to step the company in the correct direction for the current industrial market conditions, where the business may have a competitive advantage to grow. A company goal may be for:

- Retention - e.g. increase customer satisfaction, provide more customer value with customer loyalty programs and gratuities.
- Growth - e.g. broaden customer outreach with more diverse and competitive offer.
- Maximising profit or increased revenue - e.g. improved efficiency and lower operational overhead.
- Attract and retain talent - e.g. setup an employee reward program.

Importantly the goals should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound), this methodology allows for clear and accountable direction, where all employees know how they're helping achieve success for the company, as well as inform everyone how they should approach day-to-day decision making.

There should be metrics in place to indicate which goals should drive your business, for instance, is your company's customer acquisition cost (CAC) low? Then maybe growing your outreach through marketing a good option. Or is your customer lifetime value (LTV) high? Then retention would be a great option in order to maximise this. Both are important in making up the LTV:CAC ratio benchmark. This is one metric your business should be tracking, others might be lead conversion rate, monthly recurring revenue (MRR) expansion rate, monthly active users (MAU) and many more.

This furthered with PESTLE and/or SWOT analysis can lead to an incredibly informed decision making in company strategic goals.

As a leader, keeping you ear to the ground, understanding how any external changes may  affect your team, is important to readjust priorities.

## Ownership & Accountability

As a leader, you are responsible for you division of the business area you have been entrusted with.

As part of this, you need to prove and grow trust that your area

## Empowering Team Members

It's crucial to help your team(s) maximise their efficiency whilst preventing quality decay. Streamlining work with clear priorities, requirements and highlighting dependencies ahead of time is very important to preventing time wastage in changing requirements or misinterpretations. This ambiguity can be lessened with processes such as reviewing upcoming work and refining it, within this process you need to keep a keen eye on potential dependencies or duplicate work effort to avoid wastage.

Team efficiency can also be

For a growing team documentation for onboarding and regular knowledge sharing sessions is very important to ensure your team is equipped with the relevant skills to be effective and to feel impactful in helping the team's success.

These team processes should also be continuously improved for more effectiveness and efficiency, based of metrics such as DORA, velocity and more.

## Successes

Your success should not be based off what you can produce as an individual or individual milestones and successes, instead your success should be based off your team's success. Aligning your successes with the team will ensure you're able to set your team up for success.
