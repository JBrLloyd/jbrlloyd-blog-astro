[Astro](https://astro.build) is another JavaScript web framework for creating incredibly fast, sites.
Astro is opinionated to optimize speed and improved SEO rating.
It does this by rendering components server side, minimizing as much javascript required for the site
as possible and improving the SEO by sending HTML before sending required javascript, if any.

Additionally, Astro allows you to plugin and use any major UI framework such as react, vue, preact, svelte and solidjs.
These frameworks are an opt-in adapters, which you install and add into Astro config.
They work through calling the framework to create elements, taking the HTML output and passing it to Astro, and any
client side javascript can be sent down to the client browser explicitly.
An example of how we'd setup solidjs with client side javascript is as such:

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import solidJs from '@astrojs/solid-js';

export default defineConfig({
  site: 'https://example.com',
  integrations: [solidJs()]
});
```

```tsx
// SolidJsCounter.tsx
import { type Component, createSignal } from 'solid-js';

export default const SolidJsCounter : Component = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

  return (
    <>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count => count-1)}>Decrement</button>
      &nbsp;
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count => count+1)}>Increment</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

```js
// index.astro
---
import SolidJsCounter from './SolidJsCounter.tsx';
---
// Without client directive `client:load` no javascript will be sent to the browser
// and therefore the on click will not do anything.
<SolidJsCounter client:load />
```


However, the base framework requires developing the app with HTML & javascript (can have typescript) in a markdown like files.
